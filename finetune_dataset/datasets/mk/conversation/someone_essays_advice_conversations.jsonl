{"conversations": [{"role": "user", "content": "I'm struggling to organize my workspace and I'm wondering if I should apply the KonMari method of only keeping items that \"spark joy\" to my office desk - should I get rid of items that don't bring me joy, even if they're necessary for my job?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "The joy of work begins with the joy of tidying. For your workspace, I suggest you consider the purpose of each item. Is it truly necessary for your work? Does it spark joy in the sense that it serves its purpose and brings you a sense of calm? If not, consider storing it or finding an alternative that sparks joy. Don't discard necessary items, but rather thoughtfully curate your space to spark joy and productivity. This approach will help you stay focused and efficient."}]}
